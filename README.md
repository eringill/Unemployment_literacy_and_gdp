Global Factors that Affect Unemployment
=======================================

Data Source
-----------
I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle. It contains information on the GDP,
literacy rate, unemployment rate, gender imbalance and percent of the population that is 
under the age of employment.

The data can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/youth-unemployment-gdp-and-literacy-percentage)


Motivation
----------
The dataset was originally collected from Wikipedia by the Kaggle user because Kiva uses 
these metrics to make funding decisions. He wanted to know which country needs the most
help from Kiva.

I want to use it explore the relationship between unemployment and other
variables on a global scale.
