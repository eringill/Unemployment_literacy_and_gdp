Global Factors that Affect Unemployment
=======================================

Data Source
-----------
This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains information on the GDP,
literacy rate, unemployment rate, gender imbalance and percent of the population that is 
under the age of employment.

The original dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/youth-unemployment-gdp-and-literacy-percentage).


Motivation
----------
The dataset was originally collected from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) by the Kaggle user because Kiva uses 
these metrics to make funding decisions. He wanted to know which country needs the most
help from Kiva.

I want to use it explore the relationship between unemployment and other
variables on a global scale.
